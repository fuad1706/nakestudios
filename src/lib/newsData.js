      Leading voices from across Nigeria's creative landscape gathered last week for the inaugural iCre8 conference, organized by Nakestudios to address the evolving role of creativity in business and society.
      
      The event highlighted the growing importance of creative thinking as a driver of innovation across multiple sectors, from entertainment and media to technology and manufacturing.
      
      "Creativity is no longer just about arts and culture," noted keynote speaker Dr. Amina Ibrahim. "It's becoming the essential skill for problem-solving in virtually every industry as we navigate increasingly complex global challenges."
      
      Sessions explored topics including creative education, intellectual property protection, and the role of government policy in supporting creative industries.
      
      A recurring theme was the need for greater collaboration between creative professionals and traditional business sectors to maximize the impact of creative innovation.
      
      "The conversations we started here will continue to shape how we approach creativity as a nation," said Boluwaji Apanisile, founder of iCre8. "This is just the beginning of a much larger movement."

      The upcoming iCre8 Conference, scheduled for later this month, is set to address both the enormous potential and significant challenges facing Nigeria's creative sector.

      "Nigeria's creative economy has the potential to be a major contributor to GDP and employment," explains conference director Boluwaji Apanisile. "But we need to address issues like inadequate infrastructure, limited access to financing, and intellectual property violations."
      
      The conference will feature workshops on business development, discussions on policy reforms, and presentations on successful case studies from Nigeria and beyond.
      
      Industry experts anticipate that the outcomes of the conference could influence both government policy and private sector investment in coming years.
      
      "This is about recognizing that the creative industries aren't just about culture—they're about commerce, jobs, and economic development," says Apanisile. "We need to start treating them with the seriousness they deserve."
